# App-Ops
For this exercise we provide one CSV file that contains the type of data you would normally come across on the job. It isn’t necessary to understand the meaning behind the data to complete the exercise. 
Use JavaScript.
All of your results should be made avaliable in another file called FILE B.
1. Write a script that extracts and lists Name and FavoriteFridge1.
2. Write a script that will extract and list Jill, Candice, and Alycia’s items and create a column for total cost. 
3. Write a script that can be used to update the CSV to change all FavoriteFridge1 to FavoriteFridge2 at 11pm on Sunday 12 January 2019.
